A technology nerd who likes to code and listen to music instead of focusing on studies. I attend my uni lectures to fulfill my attendance quota. Fun fact: I can write code faster than I can decide what to eat for lunch. Also, I once tried to fix a bug for 6 hours, only to realize it was a missing semicolon. True story!</p>
